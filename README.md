# About Me

Hi, Iâ€™m Ron Vallejo, an IT professional and educator based in Rexburg, Idaho. I currently serve as the IT Service Desk Manager at [Brigham Young University-Idaho](https://www.byui.edu/), where I lead a talented team of college students who balance their academic pursuits with delivering top-notch technical support to our students across the globe. My role focuses on optimizing our IT operations through good ol' fashioned customer service, coupled with AI, automation, and innovative service management solutions.

In addition to my management role, Iâ€™m an Adjunct Professor in the Department of Computer Science at Brigham Young University-Idaho, where I teach the Introduction to Programming course. Iâ€™m passionate about guiding students through their first steps in coding and problem-solving, showing them how programming can be applied to real-world scenarios and professional success.

With over a decade of experience in both business and technology, Iâ€™m passionate about leveraging new tools and strategies to enhance operational efficiency. My educational background includes a Bachelor's in Business Management and Social Media, and Iâ€™m currently finalizing my Masterâ€™s in IT Management with a focus on AI and automation. Iâ€™m a big believer in innovation and growth, whether it's in my professional career, personal life, or teaching. Iâ€™m here to share my journey, my insights, and hopefully inspire others along the way. ðŸš€ Check out an example of an AI application I developed [Atreyu.AI](https://atreyu.streamlit.app/).

Iâ€™m also a member of the [Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/), and my faith in Jesus Christ is central to everything I do. If anyone would like to know more about my faith, the Book of Mormon, or simply wants to discuss beliefs, please reach out! Just as importantly, Iâ€™m a husband and father of five, navigating life with ADHD while striving to turn its challenges into strengths.
