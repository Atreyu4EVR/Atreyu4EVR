# About Me

Hi, I‚Äôm Ron Vallejo, an IT professional and educator based in Rexburg, Idaho. I currently serve as the IT Service Desk Manager at Brigham Young University-Idaho, where I lead a talented team of 35-40 college students who balance their academic pursuits with delivering top-notch technical support to our students across the globe. My role focuses on optimizing our IT operations through good ol' fashioned customer service coupled with AI, automation, and innovative service management solutions.

In addition to my management role, I‚Äôm an Adjunct Professor of Computer Science at BYU-Idaho, where I teach an Intro to Programming (Python) course. I‚Äôm passionate about guiding students through their first steps in coding and problem-solving, showing them how programming can be applied to real-world scenarios and professional success.

With over a decade of experience in both business and technology, I‚Äôm passionate about leveraging new tools and strategies to enhance operational efficiency. My educational background includes a Bachelor's in Business Management and Social Media, and I‚Äôm currently finalizing my Master‚Äôs in IT Management with a focus on AI and automation.

I‚Äôm also a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and my faith in Jesus Christ is central to everything I do. If anyone would like to know more about my faith, the Book of Mormon, or simply wants to discuss beliefs, I invite you to message me!

Beyond work, I‚Äôm a husband and father of five, navigating life with ADHD while striving to turn its challenges into strengths. I‚Äôm also an avid tech enthusiast, keeping up with the latest trends in AI and automation, and I enjoy playing Call of Duty in my downtime. Horror movies, especially paranormal ones like The Conjuring and Insidious, are a go-to escape for me when I need to unwind.

I‚Äôm a big believer in innovation and growth, whether it's in my professional career, personal life, or teaching. I‚Äôm here to share my journey, my insights, and hopefully inspire others along the way. If you‚Äôre passionate about tech, AI, automation, or just looking for tips on balancing a busy life, feel free to connect with me!
