# About Me

AI Engineer, researcher, and educator based in Rexburg, Idaho. Currently leading AI development at Brigham Young University–Idaho, where I build intelligent automation systems, deploy support agents, and conduct applied research in retrieval-augmented generation. My work spans OpenAI, Anthropic, HuggingFace, and local inference tools, with a focus on leveraging AI to enhance cost, quality, experience, and reach—core principles guiding BYU-Idaho's digital transformation strategy.

Adjunct Professor in Computer Science, teaching Introduction to Programming with an emphasis on hands-on, project-based learning. Background in IT management blends architecture, development, and innovation.

Committed to helping others grow through challenges—including ADHD—while actively mentoring and building systems that uplift. A husband, father of five, and disciple of Jesus Christ. Open to conversations about faith, technology, leadership, and how they intersect.

## Research

### Contextual Retrieval for LDS Standard Works
An applied research project implementing Anthropic's Contextual Retrieval methodology for scripture study. This work addresses the challenge of retrieving relevant verses when queries use modern vocabulary that differs from archaic scriptural language.

**Key contributions:**
- Developed a clean-room methodology for generating retrieval-optimized context without using copyrighted Church study aids
- Demonstrated 5.4% improvement in Precision@5 and 4.6% improvement in NDCG@10 over traditional RAG approaches
- Discovered that general-purpose reranking models degrade performance on specialized religious texts (p=0.011)
